# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
Created a daily planner to add events during a 9-5 standard business day. The current Date/Day is displayed at the top of the page. The time blocks are color coded to show the past, present and future times. Grey being the past, red the present and green the future. When events are typed in and saved, the text is saved in local storage and the text persists when the page is refreshed. I also added a feature where the save button is disabled when no text is input.
I made this using VsCode. Jquery, bootstrap, and Day.js.
